#!/bin/bash

# This should be a shell script that creates a backup of all Subversion
# repositories in a given directory and gzips the result.
#
# A command line argument may be given to indicate the type of the backup,
# which should be 'daily', 'weekly', or 'monthly'. This is used to generate
# a location for the backup. Default backup type is 'daily'.
#
# It also copies the backup to a static directory (latest backup).
#
# To run periodically from a scheduler like cron, for example:
#
#   $ crontab -l
#   # Daily at 03:07
#     7 3 * * *  ~/bin/svn-backup daily >> /var/log/svn-backup 2>&1
#   # Weekly at 04:07
#     7 4 1 * *  ~/bin/svn-backup weekly >> /var/log/svn-backup 2>&1
#   # Monthly at 05:07
#     7 5 * * 1  ~/bin/svn-backup monthly >> /var/log/svn-backup 2>&1
