These files are in the public domain; they can be used for whatever purpose
with absolutely no restrictions.

Originally this repository contained a directory for each host, containing
the dotfiles for that host. But they started to diverge too mutch due to the
manual synching that was involved.

Another solution to this which I'm currently trying here is to have a master
branch with 'common' dotfiles and a branch for each diverging host. Now I
just need to keep the branches in sync.
