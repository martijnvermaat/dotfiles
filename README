These files are in the public domain; they can be used for whatever purpose
with absolutely no restrictions.

To tackle the problem of using dotfiles on multiple hosts I tried several
approaches. Originally this repository contained a directory for each host,
containing the dotfiles for that host. But they started to diverge too mutch
due to the manual synching that was involved.

The next approach was to have a master branch with 'common' dotfiles and a
branch for each diverging host. Now I just needed to keep the branches in
sync. But as it turned out I do not take the effort to maintain the branches.

So the current approach is to have just one set of dotfiles which ideally
should apply to all hosts universally. Where I need divergence, I either do
that inside the dotfile if possible (using for example conditionals), or by
using separate dotfiles per host (ideally referenced by one common dotfile).
