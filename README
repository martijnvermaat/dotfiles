Dotfiles
========

I share these dotfiles over all hosts I have an account on. This means they
are really only tested on Debian and Ubuntu systems, although most of it is
also working fine for me on Red Hat and Solaris. My shell and editor are Bash
and Emacs, respectively.


Bootstrapping
-------------

There is no sophisticated bootstrapping involved here. On a new account I
usually just clone this repository in `~/projects/dotfiles` and create
symbolic links from my home directory on a per-file basis.


Sharing over different hosts
----------------------------

To tackle the problem of using dotfiles on multiple hosts I tried several
approaches. Originally this repository contained a directory for each host,
containing the dotfiles for that host. But they started to diverge too mutch
due to the manual synching that was involved.

The next approach was to have a master branch with 'common' dotfiles and a
branch for each diverging host. Now I just needed to keep the branches in
sync. But as it turned out I do not take the effort to maintain the branches.

So the current approach is to have just one set of dotfiles which ideally
should apply to all hosts universally. Where I need divergence, I either do
that inside the dotfile if possible (using for example conditionals), or by
using separate dotfiles per host (ideally referenced by one common dotfile).
